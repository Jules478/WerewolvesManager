Doppelganger - need to finish implementation of methods to call doppelganger at night in a reveal roles game where the doppelganger has an action (like seer) to perform
			- implement a copied side so numbers will still be correct

Come up with better way to display commands

Hunter - change hunter to always reveal on lynch

Seer - fix issue where both Seers will wake up after death when Apprentice Seer is in game
